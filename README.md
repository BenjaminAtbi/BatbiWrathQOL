# Batbi Wrath QOL

### Features

#### Remove Outline
When you activate highlight view, your party members will not be surrounded by a green outline. This is primarily intended to work in concert with the "toggle highlight" option in [Toybox](https://github.com/xADDBx/ToyBox-Wrath), so you don't have an ugly green outline around your characters at all times.

#### Remember Spell Levels
When you open the spellbook popup on the hotbar, it will remember the spell lvl page it was previously open to for that character. In the base game, whenever you close the popup or switch characters, it resets back to the cantrip page.
